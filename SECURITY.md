# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in VaultDeck, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainer at your preferred contact address or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices
- Do not commit secrets, passwords, or API keys to the repository.
- Always use the latest dependencies and keep your Flutter environment up to date.
- Review third-party packages for security and privacy practices.

Thank you for helping keep VaultDeck and its users safe!
